## Background
I chose to build Connect Four for my Unit 1 project because it was a game I played as a kid. Though I have played some of the other games listed on the Unit 1 project recommendations list, I felt that from a Javascript logic standpoint this would be my best option. As I continue to grow as a developer my skills will improve, but where I stand now this game was the right amount of difficulty I needed to succeed. Please enjoy my Connect Four game!
